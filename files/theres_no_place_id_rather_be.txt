I've walked the streets of Cairo and Bombay
I've seen the neon signs on old Broadway
I've climbed the Eiffel Tower
The Great Wall in one hour
Experienced sweet and sour but that's okay

Seen Hollywood, the sunsets in LA
The London Bridge, Big Ben, The Thames, UK
I've crossed the River Kwai
Yet still I don't know why
I think of you each night and every day

There's no place I'd rather be
You'll always be a part of me
And even though I've roamed the world
It's still my home I long to see

This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I'll cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

'Cause there's no place I'd rather be
