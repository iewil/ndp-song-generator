Raise your head to the skies, this is how we all begin
See the fire in your eyes, feel the yearning deep within
Take a leap and you will fly with all the wishes that you own
Make your dreams light up the sky, home is where you're not alone

And our hearts will beat together, echoing what dreams may come
Walking tall in any weather, time has come bang the drum
'Cause tomorrow's here today

Dream away, take the world by the hand
Cause tomorrow's here today
Dream away, come let's go right away
Cause tomorrow's here today

Step into a brand new day, tomorrow's calling out your name
When you know just who you are, you can't stop you are on fire
Looking up beyond the stars, fly the flag and raise it higher

And our hearts will beat together, echoing what dreams may come
Walking tall in any weather, time has come bang the drum
'Cause tomorrow's here today

When we run along and we're standing tall
When we sing our song, no way that we can fall
Be what we want to be, when we make our way
Till it's plain to see, tomorrow's here today

Yeah! Take the world by the hand
'Cause tomorrow's here today
Yeah! Come let's go right away
'Cause tomorrow's here today
