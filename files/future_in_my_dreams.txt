The early migrants embraced new challenges and reached new heights. Mer-li could feel the potential of this land and he saw the possibilities in Future in My Dreams."

In my dreams, I see the oceans, in my dreams
In my dreams, I see, birds are flying free!
Someday, one day
Every heart will see the light
Someday, one day it will be
Glory, beauty
Every hope and wish come true
There's a future and it's in my dreams

In my dreams, I see the peoples, in my dreams
In my dreams, we reach across the land and sea!

In my dreams I see people coming here. To build their homes from the north, the south, the east, the west. 
I see the people putting their energy, time and effort, working together. People making history, the people building our future.
I see my friends finding their new homes. I see countries uniting, working harmoniously togeher.
This is the future, and I see them all in my dreams.

Someday, one day
Every heart will see the light
Someday, one day it will be
Glory, freedom
Every hope and wish come true
There's a future and it's in my dreams
Oh...! Yes! We see the future in our dreams!
