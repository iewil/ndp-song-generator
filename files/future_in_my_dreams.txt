In my dreams, I see the oceans, in my dreams
In my dreams, I see, birds are flying free!
Someday, one day
Every heart will see the light
Someday, one day it will be
Glory, beauty
Every hope and wish come true
There's a future and it's in my dreams

In my dreams, I see the peoples, in my dreams
In my dreams, we reach across the land and sea!

Someday, one day
Every heart will see the light
Somday, one day it will be
Glory, freedom
Every hope and wish come true
There's a future and it's in my dreams
Oh...! Yes! We see the future in our dreams!
